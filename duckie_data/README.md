# The Project Data Folder
Here is the all the data used by our project, including training images and evaluation images and annotations (bounding 
boxes). We also provide the TFRecord format data in 'TF_Record_Data' directory. You can use them directly for training.
We provide all the customized files which will be needed by TensorFlow Object Detection API in the 'Files_Used_by_TF_OBJ_API' 
folder.
